# Biography

He is currently the leader of Language Research team, which is the NLP group of [NAVER AI LAB](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/publications/all), and the technical leader of Conversation team, which is a NLP modeling group of NAVER CLOVA for chatbots, callbots, and large-scale NLU models. He has also been an adjunct professor at [KAIST Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI (KAIST AI)](http://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) since Oct 2021. His recent research interests include task-oriented dialogue, large-scale language models (GPT-3 scale), and a variety of other NLP tasks. When he joined Naver in July 2018, he founded and became the first member of DUET, an AI ARS project which is now extended to [Contact Center AI (CCAI)](https://clova.ai/aicontactcenter) project (AiCall, CareCall, ...)
